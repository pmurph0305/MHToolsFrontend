# MHToolsFrontend

This project is the front end of a website that provides users with various tools to help manage, cope, and track mental health issues. As mental health is a very important aspect of my life, it was important to me to create an application that has the potential to help others better cope with their mental health problems as well.

This project was created as a way to learn many different concepts of both frontend and backend web development. The frontend was created to better understand various aspects of React, Redux, Sass, express, node, and testing. The backend can be viewed in it's own repo here: https://github.com/pmurph0305/MHToolsBackend and was created using express, node, and postgres.

Currently, in the code often times similar things are done in different ways. This was done to better understand and familiarize myself with different concepts, methods, and practices. The plan is to continue to use this project as a way to better understand web development.

This project can be ran locally using `npm start` and will eventually be deployed on gh-pages with the back-end deployed on heroku.
