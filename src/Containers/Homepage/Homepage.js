              A list of tasks you need to get done throughout the day to stay
              healthy. Writing these down and remembering to do them daily is an
              important step towards wellness. An important thing to remember is
              that this is a list of things you must do to stay healthy, not
              things you would normally choose to do. Try to keep the list a
              reasonable length, so you can accomplish all the tasks each day.
              Some examples of tasks would be brushing your teeth, having a
              shower, taking medication, eating 3 meals, and 15 minutes of
              physical activity
